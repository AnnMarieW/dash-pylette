### Getting Started

1. **Select Image**: Choose an image from the dropdown menu or upload your own.  

Configure Pylette

2. **Sort Colors By** - will sort the color palette by the frequency or the luminance (perceived brightness).
3. **Color Quantization Mode** - to specify the color quantization method - either using K-Means (default) or Median-Cut algorithms.
4. **Palette Color Count** - set the number of colors in the palette
5. **Resize** - resize the image to a more manageable size before beginning color extraction. This significantly speeds up the extraction, but reduces the faithfulness of the color palette.
6. **Generate Palette**: Let Pylette work its magic and extract a color palette from the selected image.

Use the generated Color Palette  

7. **Explore**: Explore the extracted colors and pick your favorites using the color picker.
8. **Set Frame Color**: Set the selected color as the frame color for the image to see it in action.
9. **Experiment**: Try out different images, algorithms, and sorting methods to discover unique color combinations.
10. **Copy the Color Palette**: Use the generated color palette in your onw project!
